# StatisticalModeling
To build statistical model and Get inference from the data
First thing first :
---What is difference between statistical modeling and ML modeling ?
    Statistical Modeling: Primary goal = Understanding relationships (inference)
    Machine Learning: Primary goal = Accurate predictions (prediction)
The confusion arieses due method like Linear regression ,which is labelled as statistical method and ML method some time .

Same algorithm, different purposes:
Statistics: Interpret coefficients, test hypotheses
ML: Optimize prediction accuracy on test data
It "becomes ML" when you focus on train/test splits, cross-validation, and generalization performance
Somo of the comman confusons and there answers:
  Q. How is linear regression both statistics and ML?
  A. Statistics: Uses it for understanding relationships
     ML: Uses it for making predictions
  Q. If I have coefficients, can't I just predict?
  A. Yes, but ML focuses on optimizing those predictions and testing generalization
  Q. Do we never use statistical models for prediction?
  A. Correct - prediction is a byproduct in statistics, but the primary goal in ML
  Q. What about polynomial/logarithmic functions?"
  A. Statistics: Choose form based on theory
     ML: Try multiple forms, pick what predicts best
